# ProcessAdminSettings

This module enables you to link the edit page of an existing page in your tree to the admin main menu. 

I use it to store theme related settings at a place where clients easily find it. You can use `$settings = $pages->get("id=12345")`, with you specific page-id, and refer to it all over your templates.
