# ProcessAdminSettings

This module enables you to link the edit page of an existing page in your tree to the admin main menu. 

I use it to store theme related settings in a seperate Page, but it's hidden somewhere in the pagetree. With this module it's easy to link such pages to the main menu, where clients can find it.
