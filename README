# ProcessAdminSettings

This module enables you to link the edit page of an existing page in your tree to the admin main menu. 

I use it to store themerelated settings at a place where clients easily find it. At the top of your templates you can use `$settings = $pages->get("id=12345")`, with you specific page-id, and use it all over your template.
